- Every PR should address an issue on the repository. If the issue doesn't exist, please create it first.
- Pull requests should always follow the following naming convention: 
`[issue-number]-[pr-name]`. For example,
to address issue #2055 which refers to a style bug, the PR addressing it should have a name that looks something like
 `2055-fix-style-bug`.
- Commit messages should always be prefixed with the number of the issue that they address. 
For example, `#2055: Remove redundant space.`
- After your PR is merged to master:
    - Delete the branch.
    - Mark the issue it addresses with the `merged-to-master` label.
    - Close the issue **only** if the change was released.

### Build 
 After every successful build on travis, a Docker image is built. Every image is tagged twice:

 - `$TRAVIS_BRANCH` [travis' environment variable](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables)
